This is a Web Application with Node.js, Express.js, and Database Integration
Project Overview:
This web application is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for users to sign up and sign in, utilizing modern web technologies such as Node.js and Express.js, integrated with a database for persistent data storage.
Key Features and Requirements are as follows...

1. Use of POST Method for Sign-In and Sign-Up:
All user authentication interactions, including sign-in and sign-up, are handled exclusively using the HTTP POST method.
This approach ensures that sensitive user information, such as passwords, is securely transmitted in the request body, enhancing the security and reliability of data submission.

3. Password Hashing in Sign-Up:
Before storing passwords in the database, the application applies password hashing using secure cryptographic algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
This transforms plain-text passwords into irreversible hashed strings, significantly improving data security and protecting user credentials from potential breaches.

3. Prevention of Email Duplication:
During sign-up, the system validates the uniqueness of the provided email address by checking if it already exists in the database.
If the email is found to be associated with an existing account, the system returns a clear error message, preventing duplicate registrations and ensuring each user account is unique.

5. User Interface (UI)
The application features a clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing UI designed for optimal user experience.
The layout, color schemes, typography, and interactive elements are thoughtfully crafted to provide a seamless and engaging interaction for users.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB, MySQL
Password Hashing: bcrypt (or equivalent secure hashing library)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and any frameworks/libraries used)

Setup and Running Instructions:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Run npm install to install all dependencies.
3.Set up your database connection (update .env or config files accordingly).
4.Run the application using npm start.
5.Access the application via http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port).

Additional Notes:
Make sure to protect your environment variables and sensitive configuration details.
Always use HTTPS in production to secure data transmission further.
